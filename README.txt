This is a simple python script that parses the Canada Revenue Agency's 2012 tax assessment data.  The data is included here in the CSV files; currently the script only looks at the Table 2 data.

The data was downloaded from:
http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/gncy/stts/t1fnl/2012/menu-eng.html

A PDF in this repo contains a printout of the above page which has descriptions of the available data fields.  Only a very small amount are currently used by the script.

The script was run on the data and produced the results located in results.txt.  It shows income distribution figures as well as tax distribution and effective tax rates for different proportions of the populations, partitioned by province or territory.
